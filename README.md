# Automobile bearing fault diagnosis method based on Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks

Our team project aims at the problem that the amount of parameter and calculation is large by using convolutional neural network to analyze the automobile bearing fault condition, our team project proposes a method for automobile bearing fault diagnosis based on inverted residuals with linear bottlenecks (IRLB). First of all, the collected signals are used to enhance the bearing data of the driving end and the fan section by the overlapping sampling method to obtain $2*512$ samples. Subsequently, the obtained sample is transformed into a $32*32$ two-dimensional matrix as the input feature of IRLB, and the fault diagnosis and analysis are performed. By testing and comparing five kinds of optimizers, the ADAM optimizer with the best performance is selected as the optimizer of this model. Finally, the sample database was tested by IRLB. The results showed that the test accuracy of IRLB reached 99.4%, and the amount of calculation and parameters was only 2.7M and 0.92Mb, which was far less than the calculation amounts of 8.8M and 2008.6M, and the number of parameters convolutional neural networks with similar structures and deep convolutional neural networks of 3.2Mb and 223.5Mb. Apart from the machine learning part, we also implement real time sensing, diagnosis, and edge device communication via Bluetooth 4.0.
